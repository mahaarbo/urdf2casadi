# URDF2CASADI
A module for generating the forward kinematics of a robot from a URDF. It can generate the forward kinematics represented as a dual quaternion or a transformation matrix. `urdf2casadi` works both in python 2 and 3, and any platform that supports `CasADi` and `urdf_parser_py`.

## Other libraries
This module is implemented in Python, and was intended to explore a CasADi approach to forward kinematics and rigid body dynamics algorithms based on URDFs. For a more real-time control applicable alternative, consider the [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) library.

## Installation
With ROS:
1. [Get ROS](http://www.ros.org/install/) (actually anything that installs `urdfdom_py`/`urdf_parser_py` will do).
2. [Get CasADi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationInstructions) (e.g. `pip install casadi`).
3. Run `pip install --user .` in the folder.

Without ROS:
1. Change the `urdfdom-py` to `urdf-parser-py` in `requirements.txt` (line 3) and in `setup.py` (line 20).
2. [Get CasADi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationInstructions) (e.g. `pip install casadi`).
3.  Run `pip install --user .` in the folder (`--user` specifies that it is a local install).

Install with poetry:
1. `git clone urdf2casadi`
2. Install poetry as described on the [website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
3. Run `poetry install` in the directory.

## Usage example
```python
import casadi as cs
from urdf2casadi import urdfparser as u2c
urdf_path = "../urdf/ur5_mod.urdf"
root_link = "base_link"
end_link = "tool0"
robot_parser = u2c.URDFparser()
robot_parser.from_file(urdf_path)
# Also supports .from_server for ros parameter server, or .from_string if you have the URDF as a string.
fk_dict = robot_parser.get_forward_kinematics(root_link, end_link)
print(fk_dict.keys())
# should give ['q', 'upper', 'lower', 'dual_quaternion_fk', 'joint_names', 'T_fk', 'joint_list', 'quaternion_fk']
forward_kinematics = fk_dict["T_fk"]
print(forward_kinematics([0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0., 0.3, 0.7]))
```
